Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches\r\nif they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)\r\nor are controversial.\r\n\r\nThe master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed\r\nto be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new\r\nofficial, stable release versions of NovaCoin.\r\n\r\nFeature branches are created when there are major new features being\r\nworked on by several people.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and\r\nthe pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will\r\nbe used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days\r\nafter the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed\r\nin this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.\r\n\r\nIssues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after\r\n15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be \r\nlabeled 'stale'.\r\n",
